# Fake-WhatsApp
Create fake WhatsApp conversations, memes, and whatever your sick imagination makes you do.

# Goals
This is more of a playground for me to test some front-end tricks, while creating something (sorta) useful.

I'd like to achieve a level where this tool is fast to load and has a responsive design, usable on every device.
On the technical side, I'd like to exercise a bit with RequireJS and, if it'll apply, Backbone.js.

# Running locally

* `$ npm install`
