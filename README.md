# Fake-WhatsApp
Create fake WhatsApp conversations, memes, and whatever your sick imagination makes you do.

# Goals
This is more of a playground for me to test some front-end tricks, while creating something (sorta) useful.

I'd like to achieve a level where this tool is fast to load and has a responsive design, usable on every device.

# Running locally
Clone this repository, then:

* `$ npm install`
* `$ grunt dev|production`

And open public/index.html with your browser.
